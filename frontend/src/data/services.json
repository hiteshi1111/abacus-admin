Although it is generally hosted on-premises data centres of a customer, it can be hosted on infrastructure of an independent Cloud provider and on rented infrastructure placed in an offsite data centre.</p> <p>Companies are often seen choosing private cloud service providers over the public cloud ones as it is a convenient and easier method to meet their supervisory compliance requirements. Another reason for giving preference to private cloud is the workload of confidential documents like property, medical records, financial records or any kind of sensitive data which is must to protect.</p> </div><div> <h2>What are the types of <b>Private Cloud services?</b></h2> <p>There are basically 3 types of <b>Private Cloud Services</b>:</p> <ul> <li><h3>On-premises Private Cloud:</h3></li> <p>An on-premises <b>private cloud server</b> is the one that can be deployed in your own internal data centre and which you need not to share with anyone else, as it is just for your own company to use. It gives you more control on how to use it like keeping your data more secure and making sure it follows all the rules and regulations your company needs to abide by. The only drawback is high initial investment.</p> <li><h3>Managed Private Cloud:</h3></li><p>A Managed <b>Private Cloud network</b> is like having your own personal computer for your company which is managed by a third party unlike on-premises private cloud, where you are responsible for everything. In this private Cloud server,  the third party ensures maintenance, upgrades, every kind of support for your private cloud resources. Although these prove to be expensive, they offer more convenience than on-premises solutions.</p><li><h3>Virtual private cloud:</h3></li><p>A <b>virtual private cloud company</b> provides a personal space within a public cloud infrastructure. The term virtual is used because it exists online and private means it is just for you means having your own virtual private space. It is a more secure and isolated environment which your activities separate from others on the internet.</p></ul></div><div><h2>How does <b>private cloud technologies</b> work?</h2><p>The architecture of private cloud servers is the same as of public cloud, so it requires implementation of similar technologies. Below given is the explanation of how it works:</p><ul> <li><h3>Virtualization:</h3></li> <p>In virtualization, the user can virtualize hardware resources like servers and storage using software and can use them in the same way as physical machines with the help of private cloud computing providers.</p><li><h3>Infrastructure Setup:</h3></li><p>The data centre is set up by the private cloud service providers with servers, networking equipment and storage. In the hosted private cloud, infrastructure is maintained by a third party on the behalf of the organisation.</p><li><h3>Resource Allocation:</h3></li><p>In Private cloud technologies, the computing resources like virtual machines, storage and processing power are managed and allocated by the IT administrators of organisations that too according to the needs of distinct departments or applications.</p><li><h3>Automation Technologies:</h3></li><p>The automation of mundane tasks like integration, which are error-prone when done manually, is essential for efficient cloud infrastructure management. Organisations implementing a private cloud environment must offer such automation capabilities with private cloud networks.</p></ul></div>"

It assists things in your computer like storage, database or other kind of services to communicate to each other via cloud in an efficient and smooth way. In short, it helps in seamless transfer of data between two virtual machines on a cloud and makes it easier for them to communicate.</p><p>Among many benefits of interconnection, the predominant one’s are efficient communication and scalability. Along with this, these are very reliable,as these lessen the impact of failures, thereby, improves the overall reliability of the cloud infrastructure. Further, secure transfer of information is ensured by it, so there is no threat regarding security.</p></div><div><h2>What are the types of <b>Cloud Interconnection</b>?</h2><p><b>Cloud interconnection</b> is a service of creating paths between different parts of the network to provide seamless flow of data between different components and cloud environments. There are many types of <b>interconnection services</b>:</p><ul><li><h3>Public Internet Connectivity:</h3></li><p>In Public internet connectivity, all the cloud services and applications could easily be accessed over the public internet which allows users to establish contact with the cloud from anywhere with the help of the internet.</p><li><h3>Direct Internet Peering</h3></li><p>Direct Internet peering in <b>Cloud service interconnection</b> means establishing direct relationship with the ISPs or CDNs as a method to optimise internet connectivity as well as to decrease latency.</p><li><h3>Virtual Private Network:</h3></li><p>These networks are secure and allow users to connect to resources over the cloud in a secure way by providing secure and encrypted internet connections.</p><li><h3>Inter-Region Connectivity:</h3></li><p><b>Cloud interconnection service providers</b> provide network connections in different geographical regions.

An enterprise could build a search engine for which experiments could be run and new features could be tested to improve its search functionality.</p><li><h3>Secondary Storage:</h3></li><p>Via <b>VPS hosting server</b>, a secondary storage for storing the data and files is provided. It is more like an extra shelf where things such as files, backup or additional applications could be stored.</p><li><h3>Virtualisation Technology:</h3></li><p>In order to divide a physical server into multiple isolated virtual servers,  virtualisation technology is being used in cloud VPS hosting.
